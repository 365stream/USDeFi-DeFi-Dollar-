# USDeFi (DeFi-Dollar)
Collateralized Stable Coin

A “collateralized stablecoin” is a stablecoin that is entirely or almost entirely backed by collateral held in a reserve. Notable examples of fully-collateralized stablecoins include USDT, USDC and DAI. The collateral is used to provide holders of the token with an opportunity to redeem the tokens for U.S. dollars or other assets that can then be used in the real world.

USDeFi (DeFi Dollar) is a decentralized, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the BitFi.  is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms, and is supported on Binance Chain.
USDeFi is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate USDeFi by depositing collateral assets into BitFi (Bitcoin DeFi) through the AI platform or launchpool. This is how USDeFi is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain USDeFi by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.
Once generated, bought, or received, USDeFi can be used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: it can be sent to others, used as payments for goods and services.
Every USDeFi in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the USDeFi debt, and all USDeFi transactions are publicly viewable on the Binance Chain.
